# OnepostUI

OnePost is social media management infrastructure for the internet. Companies use our API to create, post, and manage their social presence via programmatic communication. You can think of it like a headless Hootsuite built for developers. Learn more at [https://www.getonepost.com/](https://www.getonepost.com/).

If you're using the OnePost API to build a web application, use this prebuilt UI to get up and running as quickly as possible.

1. Pick your social accounts (Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram) you want to post to.
2. Add your post's text and/or image. You can preview what your post will look for each social network as you type.
3. Publish your post immediately to all accounts when your post is perfect (or schedule for a later time).
