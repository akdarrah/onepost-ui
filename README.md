# OnepostUI

OnePost is social media management infrastructure for the internet. Companies use our API to create, post, and manage their social presence via programmatic communication. You can think of it like a headless Hootsuite built for developers. Learn more at [https://www.getonepost.com/](https://www.getonepost.com/).

Using the OnePost API, you are able to build a custom UI yourself to fit your application. However, if you're building a web appliation and looking for an existing UI that is built to work with the Onepost API directly, then this is it!

This UI is completely responsive and easy to use:

1. Pick from your list of "Authorized pages" (aka your authorized Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram accounts)
2. Add your post's text or image. Preview what your post will look for each social network.
3. When you're ready, you can post immediately or schedule for a later date.
